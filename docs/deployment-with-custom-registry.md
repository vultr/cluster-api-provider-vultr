### To Deploy on the cluster
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `CONTROLLER_IMAGE`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push CONTROLLER_IMAGE=<some-registry>/cluster-api-provider-vultr:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified. 
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment. 
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands donâ€™t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `CONTROLLER_IMAGE`:**

```sh
make deploy CONTROLLER_IMAGE=<some-registry>/cluster-api-provider-vultr:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin 
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Project Distribution

Following are the steps to build the installer and distribute this project to users.

1. Build the installer for the image built and published in the registry:

```sh
make build-installer CONTROLLER_IMAGE=<some-registry>/cluster-api-provider-vultr:tag
```

NOTE: The makefile target mentioned above generates an 'install.yaml'
file in the dist directory. This file contains all the resources built
with Kustomize, which are necessary to install this project without
its dependencies.

2. Using the installer

Users can just run kubectl apply -f <URL for YAML BUNDLE> to install the project, i.e.:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/cluster-api-provider-vultr/<tag or branch>/dist/install.yaml
```


**NOTE:** Run `make help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
